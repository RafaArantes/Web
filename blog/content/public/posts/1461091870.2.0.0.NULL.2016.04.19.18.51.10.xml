"I never see the entire chain running Linux. Twenty five years ago I started Linux wanting a workstation. From that to a server wasn't a surprise. There was no single point where I was surprised, but 15 years ago I started seeing these odd, embedded systems. The first one that really caught my eye was a gas pump running Linux."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Torvalds continued, "Many changes have been invisible. Even I don't see all the uses of Linux."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Linux isn't the right operating system for all embedded devices. After all, the Linux kernel keeps growing. Therefore, Torvalds said, "If you're doing something really tiny, like sensors, you don't need Linux."Â &lt;/p&gt;&#13;
